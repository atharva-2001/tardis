Running TARDIS
**************

The TARDIS code needs three components to calculate spectra: 1) an atom database
2) a model 3) a configuration file. The Atom Database is created by the
`Carsus <https://tardis-sn.github.io/carsus/>`_ subpackage. A quick start guide
to run TARDIS can be found :ref:`here <quickstart>`

Running TARDIS interactively in a Jupyter notebook (recommended)
================================================================

To get more information from each run of TARDIS one can run it interactively and
have full access to the model properties (as described in :ref:`physical_quantities`)
