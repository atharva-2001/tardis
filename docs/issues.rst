Reporting Issues
****************

TARDIS is under constant development. Thus, changes are high that some things
do not operate as intended. If find bugs, inconsistencies or missing
functionalities, file an issue on our official `github
<https://github.com/tardis-sn/tardis>`_ page.

We encourage any interested user to actively contribute to the development of
TARDIS. Just follow some basic principles outlined on our :doc:`Contributing
HowTo <workflow/development_workflow>` and get started.
