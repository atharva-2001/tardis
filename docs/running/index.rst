Running TARDIS
**************

The TARDIS code needs three components to calculate spectra: 1) an Atom Database
2) a model 3) a configuration file. The Atom Database is created by the
`Carsus <https://tardis-sn.github.io/carsus/>`_ subpackage. A quick start guide
to run TARDIS can be found `here <quickstart>`
