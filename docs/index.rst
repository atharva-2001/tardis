TARDIS is an open-source Monte Carlo radiative-transfer spectral synthesis code
for 1D models of supernova ejecta. It is designed for rapid spectral modelling
of supernovae. It is developed and maintained by a multi-disciplinary team
including software engineers, computer scientists, statisticians,
and astrophysicists.

If you use this code for any publications or presentations please follow our
citation guidelines in :ref:`tardiscredits`

User modifications and additions that lead to publications need to be handed
back to the community by incorporating them into TARDIS.
Please contact the TARDIS team via the `github page
<https://github.com/tardis-sn/tardis>`_ if you have questions or need
assistance.
